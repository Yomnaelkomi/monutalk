Proudly announcing the successful completion of my graduation project! ðŸŽ‰

I was responsible for developing the front-end Mobile application for Monutalk using Flutter and Dart.

Key Features:

Seamless User Experience: Retrieved all necessary data from the backend using efficient HTTP requests.
Comprehensive Functionality: Monutalk offers a range of features, including:
Museum Ticket Booking: Effortlessly book tickets to your favorite museums.
AI-Powered Virtual Guide: Engage with a captivating AI character that provides personalized guidance and answers your questions.
Intuitive Chat Interface: Seamlessly chat with the AI guide and receive helpful information.
Personalized Recommendations: Discover tailored recommendations based on your interests.
Secure User Accounts: Manage your account, view booking history, and access personalized settings.
Enhanced User Interaction: Image classification, reviews, comments, and sentiment analysis for a richer user experience.
User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive design for a seamless and enjoyable user journey.
Overcoming Challenges:

I faced the challenge of having no prior experience with Flutter. To overcome this, I dedicated myself to completing a comprehensive Flutter course, enabling me to successfully develop the mobile application.

I am incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to work on this project under the guidance of Dr. Mohamed Abbas.

This project was a fantastic learning experience, and I'm incredibly grateful for the collaborative efforts of my amazing team:

Georgino Nabil: Web App Development
Ali Mahmoud: Backend Development
Mohamed Elharakani & Yehia Khaled: AI Model Development
